        "CLUBHOUSE_INVITATION_PAGE_2": "Before that, how about you drop by the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Clubhouse</color>]]> for a quick game of <![CDATA[<color=orange>Hearthian Golf</color>]]>? It'll be great practice using the scout!",
        "CLUBHOUSE_INVITATION_PAGE_3": "I've added the location of the Clubhouse to your ship log. Once you've got the launch codes, use your new <![CDATA[<color=orange>Suit Log</color>]]> to mark the location of the Clubhouse, then meet me there!",


        "HIGHSCORE_PAPER_PAGE_1": "Heya! Just a quick note from your favorite astronaut, Feldspar!",
        "HIGHSCORE_PAPER_PAGE_2": "In my quest to conquer the Outer Wilds, I had to first conquer this golf course. I was able to do so in <![CDATA[<color=orange>32 strokes</color>]]>!",
        "HIGHSCORE_PAPER_PAGE_3": "Good luck if you think you can beat it!",


        "CHIP_NODE_S_PAGE_1": "Heya, hatchling! Welcome to the Clubhouse!",

        "CHIP_NODE_1_PAGE_1": "Do you have any questions about Hearthian Golf?",
        "CHIP_NODE_1_OPT_1": "How do you play Hearthian Golf?",
        "CHIP_NODE_1_OPT_2": "Are there any weird rules?",
        "CHIP_NODE_1_OPT_3": "Do you have any tips to improve my score?",
        "CHIP_NODE_1_OPT_4": "I completed the course!",
        "CHIP_NODE_1_OPT_5": "I'm ready to play!",

        "CHIP_NODE_2_PAGE_1": "In Hearthian Golf, we launch the scout from a starting location called the <![CDATA[<color=orange>tee</color>]]>, and try to land it inside of the hole. In this case, a literal <![CDATA[<color=orange>black hole</color>]]>.",
        "CHIP_NODE_2_PAGE_2": "If your shot misses the hole, use your jetpack to fly to the spot where your scout landed. Then recall your scout and fire it again. Keep going until it goes into the black hole.",
        "CHIP_NODE_2_PAGE_3": "Every time you fire your scout, that is considered a <![CDATA[<color=orange>stroke</color>]]>. Your goal is to complete the course in the <![CDATA[<color=orange>least amount of strokes</color>]]>. I left my pencil and paper back at the village, so you'll have to count them yourself.",
        "CHIP_NODE_2_PAGE_4": "After you score a scout into a hole, jump into it yourself to go to the next tee.",
        "CHIP_NODE_2_PAGE_5": "The tee for the first hole is <![CDATA[<color=orange>right behind the Clubhouse</color>]]>. When you stand on it, use your Suit Log to mark the location of the hole on your HUD. That will make it much easier to locate the hole!",

        "CHIP_NODE_3_PAGE_1": "Hearthain Golf has special rules due to the <![CDATA[<color=orange>unique properties of the scout</color>]]>.",
        "CHIP_NODE_3_PAGE_2": "First, the <![CDATA[<color=orange>tee off shot is free</color>]]>. You can make as many attempts as you want on your tee off. However, once you step off the tee, the shot counts as your first stroke.",
        "CHIP_NODE_3_PAGE_3": "Once you reach your scout, you may only recall it if you are standing still and within <![CDATA[<color=orange>10 meters</color>]]> of it. If you cannot recall it, it is considered <![CDATA[<color=orange>out of bounds</color>]]>. Take your next shot from the nearest available spot and add an additional stroke to your score.",
        "CHIP_NODE_3_PAGE_4": "Also, please don't use your ship for any shenanigans. We don't want to ruin all of Slate's work!",

        "CHIP_NODE_4_PAGE_1": "Yes, I do! Remember that the angle and target at which you fire your scout greatly effects the power that it is fired at. <![CDATA[<color=orange>The power of your shot can vary wildly with different angles</color>]]>.",
        "CHIP_NODE_4_PAGE_2": "Your scout is powerful and it can easily get away from you. Keep it low and use tall terrain like trees and mountains to control where it lands.",
        "CHIP_NODE_4_PAGE_3": "Finally, don't play by yourself. Hearthian Golf is a lot more fun when you <![CDATA[<color=orange>invite your friends to play with you</color>]]>!",

        "CHIP_NODE_5_PAGE_1": "Congratulations, hatchling! How'd you do? Are you satisfied with your score?",
        "CHIP_NODE_5_PAGE_2": "If you want to attempt a hole again, remember that you can use your Suit Log to mark the tee of the hole. If you're all done for now, thanks for playing!",
        "CHIP_NODE_5_PAGE_3": "I am currently working with other hearthians to develop <![CDATA[<color=orange>more golf courses</color>]]>. I'll give you a ring when they're done.",
        
        "CHIP_NODE_E_PAGE_1": "Have fun out there! I've put all the rules to Hearthian Golf in your ship log. <![CDATA[<color=orange>Return to me</color>]]> when you are finished!"
